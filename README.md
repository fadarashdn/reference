Given the following codebase from our internal UI library (@brdp), which includes form system, table components, and various UI elements, please help me create the requested functionality. Critical Requirements: NEVER use Ant Design directly in the implementation. All UI components must come from our @brdp/ui package which wraps and extends Ant Design. NEVER use hardcoded text strings. All user-facing text must use our internationalization pattern through message objects defined as: typescript{ messageKey: { id: "ui.messageKey", defaultMessage: "Default Text", } } NEVER use interface in TypeScript. Only use type for all type definitions. The only exception is when you absolutely cannot achieve something without interface (which is extremely rare). Follow the existing patterns and conventions established in the provided codebase. Maintain consistency with our banking system's security requirements and Persian localization support. Use TypeScript with proper type definitions as demonstrated in the reference code. Respect the monorepo structure and import paths. The codebase reference includes: Complete form system with useControlledForm hook and FormBuilder Business elements (Amount, Date, IBAN, File, Collapse, etc.) Table system with filtering, sorting, and actions Persian/Jalali calendar integration Required group validation patterns Comprehensive demo implementations Please analyze the provided code patterns and implement the requested feature following our established architecture and coding standards.
